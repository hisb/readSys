                    先生其实也喜欢热闹，只是先生的热闹并不是灯火灿烂，而是内心的安宁与独行的自在。
                    这本书写情感、聊爱好、谈社会、说人生。有俗世的智慧，也有生活的趣味。
                    对于匆匆的路人，平凹先生这部文集只是用来附庸风雅的玩物。但这本书却要写给生命的行者。愿他们能懂得孤独的真义，在生活里多一些从容潇洒。</span>

                                <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large <a href="#">language</a> ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.</p>
                                <p>She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way.</p>
